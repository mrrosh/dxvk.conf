# === DXVK Configuration for Turtle WoW ===
# System: Ryzen 5 4600H (6 cores / 12 threads) + GTX 1650 (4GB VRAM)
# Async DXVK — tuned for smooth performance on older games like Vanilla/Turtle WoW.

# Cap framerate to avoid wild spikes and overheating.
d3d9.maxFrameRate = 90                # Limit FPS to 90 — smooth + stable.

# Disable V-Sync for lower input latency.
d3d9.presentInterval = 0              # 0 = V-Sync off.
d3d9.tearFree = False                 # False = let the game handle tearing.

# Let DXVK handle buffer count automatically.
d3d9.numBackBuffers = 0               # 0 = adaptive buffer management.

# GPU VRAM allocation — match your card’s VRAM.
d3d9.maxAvailableMemory = 4096        # 4GB = safe for GTX 1650.

# Texture cache size in MB.

# Memory management tweaks for reduced stuttering.

d3d9.allowDiscard = True              # Skip redundant GPU copies when possible.

# Async shader compilation — eliminates stutter when entering new areas.

# Compilation thread limits — use all your CPU threads.
dxvk.numCompilerThreads = 12          # Ryzen 4600H = 12 threads total.
dxvk.numAsyncThreads = 6              # Safe default: half your total CPU threads.

# Shader pipeline management.
dxvk.enableGraphicsPipelineLibrary = Auto  # Reduces shader stutter.
dxvk.trackPipelineLifetime = True           # Frees unused pipelines for better memory use.
dxvk.useRawSsbo = True                      # Optimize shader memory access (GTX 1650 supports this).

# Accuracy vs performance tweaks — favor performance for WoW.

# Modernize frame presentation.
d3d9.noExplicitFrontBuffer = True           # Removes old front-buffer limitations.

# DPI scaling control (VanillaFixes handles this).
d3d9.dpiAware = False                       # False to prevent Windows scaling interference.

# Disable unused depth-stencil formats for minor FPS gain.
d3d9.supportD32 = False                     # Disabling D32 support.
d3d9.useD32forD24 = False                   # Prevent using D32 where D24 is enough.
